# Fibonacci computational complexity methods
With this class you can calculate the following different types of computational complexity to obtain a Fibonacci sequence using three different methods:

- Exponential complexity.
- Linear complexity
- Logarithmic complexity

If you want to experiment, do a demonstration, or simply teach your students what computational complexity is based on, you can download this class with Composer.

# Installation with Composer
If you're using Composer to manage dependencies, you can use
```sh
$ composer require todomagichere/fibonacci
```
